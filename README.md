# bash_mess

## A Project for my own use to exercise bash-scripting on github



At long last messing around with bash scripting, the linux CLI, Vim, Git and github.

Not to be taken too serious. This is just to get the hang of workflows.


Users:
    I can't think of any way this project could be useful for anyony other than myself but this is a work in progress. Time will tell.

Owner:
    I am working throug Jay LaCroix's Youtube bash tutorial. His is rightly the copyright. Contact me if the way I am doing things rubs your the wrong way. I mean to offend noone. Jay, thanks a bunch for all the good work you do.
