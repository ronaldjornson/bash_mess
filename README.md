# bash_mess
At long last messing around with bash scripting and github

Not to be taken too serious. This is just to get the hang of workflows.

I am working throug Jay LaCroix's bash tutorial. His is rightly the copyright. Contact me if the way I am doing things is wrong. Thanks anyway for the good work.
