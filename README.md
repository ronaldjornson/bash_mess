# bash_mess

### A Project for my own use to exercise bash-scripting on github


## Background:

  At long last I am messing around with bash scripting, the linux CLI, Vim, Git and github in one go.

This is Not to be taken too seriously. This is just trying to get the hang of the workflows.


## Users:

  I can't think of any way this project could be useful for anyony other than myself but this is a work in progress. Time will tell.
