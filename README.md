# bash_mess
At long last messing around with bash scripting and github

Not to be taken too serious. This is just to get the hang of workflows.

I am working throug Jay LaCroix's Youtube bash tutorial. His is rightly the copyright. Contact me if the way I am doing things rubs your the wrong way. I mean to offend noone. Jay, thanks a bunch for all the good work you do.
